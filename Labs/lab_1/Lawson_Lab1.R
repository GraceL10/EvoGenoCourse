### Exercise 1
x <- 3
y <- 15

# sum x + y
x + y

# difference of x and y
x - y

# product of x and y
x * y 

# quotient of x and y
x / y


### Exercise 2
x <- 2
y <- 3
x^5 > y^4

### Exercise 3
x <- c(22,62,148,43,129)

# sum of vector
sum (x)

# divide vector by sum
x / sum(x)

### Exercise 4
DNA <- c("A","T","C","G")

# sort DNA vector
sort(DNA)
